# POPout
BisonHacks Project
POPout is a website and mobile app that uses HTML & CSS to address the economic stagnation for businesses in D.C.'s low income communities.
POPout facilitates events that redirect consumers into underserved communities!
Generally: 1. We organize a free pop up event in an underserved area
            2. We acquire performances/speakers 
            3.Vendors pay for advertising and booth
            4. Participants enjoy and shop!
